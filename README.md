## The Network Reality Check

DC39v2 runs triple direct connections with mixed BGP routing. The default fallback is China Mobile International (CMI).

Here's how it actually performs across different carriers:

**Mobile users** see the best results—low latency, solid bandwidth, consistent performance. If you're on China Mobile, this is your sweet spot.

**China Unicom and Telecom users** get decent connections during off-peak hours. Prime time (evenings, weekends) can bring some slowdowns and latency bumps due to cross-carrier routing. Your mileage varies based on local network conditions.

Before committing to a full year, you might want to explore whether 👉 [BandwagonHost's network architecture suits your specific carrier setup](https://bandwagonhost.com/aff.php?aff=79616). Their triple direct routing works particularly well for mobile users, but understanding your own network environment helps set realistic expectations.

## How It Stacks Up

Let's compare apples to apples in the Japan VPS market:

**BandwagonHost DC39v2 base plan** ($73.65/year): 1 core, 1GB RAM, 500GB bandwidth. The resource allocation feels cramped for the price—you're better off jumping to the large package.

**DMIT Japan** (starting at $155/year): 1 core, 1GB RAM, 450GB bandwidth. Premium CN2 routing delivers excellent performance, but you're paying double for that guarantee. Worth it if network quality trumps budget concerns.

**BandwagonHost DC39v2 large plan** ($92.3/year): Hits the middle ground—reasonable resources, reliable mobile network performance, refund protection. It's not the cheapest option, nor the most premium, but the balance works for most users.

For mobile network users seeking predictable Japan connectivity without premium pricing, the DC39v2 large package makes practical sense.

## Before You Buy

**New account setup recommended** for full refund coverage

**Monitor your bandwidth** if you plan to test during the refund window—stay under 10% total usage

**Mobile network users** will see the most consistent performance with DC39v2's routing setup

## Bottom Line

BandwagonHost's DC39v2 large package delivers what it promises: stable triple direct routing to Japan at a mid-tier price point. It's not flashy, not revolutionary—just a solid, functional VPS that works particularly well for mobile network users. At $92.3/year with a 30-day safety net, it's a reasonable choice for users who value predictable performance over rock-bottom pricing or premium guarantees. The refund window gives you a month to verify it matches your specific network environment, which beats most alternatives in this price range.
